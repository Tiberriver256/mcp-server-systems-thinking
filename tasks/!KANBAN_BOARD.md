## Instructions

1. **Create a new task:**

   - Add a new markdown link (e.g., `- [task-name.md](./task-name.md)`) under the **TODO** section.
   - Create the corresponding `.md` file in this directory if it does not exist.

2. **Work In Progress (WIP) Limit:**

   - Only one task should be present in the **DOING** section at any time.
   - When starting work, move the top item from **TODO** to **DOING**.
   - Do not add new tasks to **DOING** unless it is empty.

3. **Move a task between statuses:**

   - Move the task's markdown link to the appropriate section (**TODO**, **DOING**, or **DONE**) as work progresses.
   - Always maintain the WIP limit in **DOING**.

4. **Complete or archive tasks:**

   - When a task is finished, move its link to **DONE**.
   - Optionally, remove links from **DONE** to archive or declutter.

5. **Formatting:**

   - Use markdown links for all tasks.
   - Keep sections in the order: TODO, DOING, DONE.
   - Only one link per line.

6. **Review regularly:**
   - Periodically review and update the board to reflect current progress.
   - Ensure the WIP limit is respected and tasks are in the correct section.
