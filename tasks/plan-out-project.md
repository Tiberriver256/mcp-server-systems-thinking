# Project Planning Complete

## Summary

Based on analysis of [PRD](../PRD.md) and [tech-stack](../tech-stack.md), I've created a comprehensive project plan with 10 sequential tasks to implement the Systems-Thinking MCP server.

## Tasks Created

1. **setup-project-structure** - Initialize npm, dependencies, folder structure, TypeScript config
2. **implement-zod-schema** - Create complete SystemDoc validation schema
3. **implement-gap-check-validation** - Build structural validation logic for cross-references
4. **implement-in-memory-storage** - Create Map-based document storage layer
5. **implement-fastmcp-server** - Build main MCP server with systems_thinking_writer tool
6. **add-unit-tests** - Comprehensive Vitest testing for validation logic
7. **setup-build-and-dev-scripts** - Configure npm scripts for dev workflow
8. **add-logging-and-health-endpoint** - Pino logging and /healthz for observability
9. **create-dockerfile** - Multi-stage container build for deployment
10. **integration-testing** - End-to-end testing with sample documents

## Key Implementation Details

- FastMCP framework for HTTP streaming transport
- Zod schema matching PRD data model exactly
- Gap validation for stock-flow references, loops, and leverage points
- In-memory storage (no persistence between restarts)
- Tool description includes full systems-thinking tutorial from PRD
- Complete=true only when validation passes with no gaps

Ready to begin implementation following the kanban WIP limit of 1 task in DOING.
